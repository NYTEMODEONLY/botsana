## User Mapping System

Botsana includes an intelligent user mapping system that connects Discord users to Asana users, enabling seamless task assignment and collaboration.

### How It Works

1. **Setup**: Administrators use `/map-user @user` to start an interactive mapping process
2. **Selection**: Bot fetches all users from your Asana workspace and presents them in a dropdown menu
3. **Mapping**: Select the correct Asana user from the list - no manual ID entry needed!
4. **Auto-Assignment**: When you create a task without specifying an assignee, it automatically assigns to your Asana account (if mapped)
5. **Mention Assignment**: You can @mention Discord users in task creation to assign tasks directly to their Asana accounts

### Example Usage

**Mapping a user:**
```
/map-user @Lobo
```
Bot shows: "Select Asana User for Lobo" with a dropdown of all Asana workspace users.

**Creating tasks:**
```
/create-task name="Fix the login bug" assignee:@developer
```

This will create a task and assign it to the Asana user mapped to `@developer` in Discord.

If you create a task without specifying an assignee:
```
/create-task name="Review the new feature"
```

It will automatically assign the task to your Asana account (assuming you've been mapped by an admin).

### Interactive Mapping Process

1. Run `/map-user @username`
2. Bot fetches all users from your Asana workspace
3. Select the correct person from the dropdown menu
4. Mapping is created instantly!

**No more manual Asana ID hunting!** üéâ

## Smart Task Operations

Botsana is intelligent about finding and managing tasks across your workspace. You can reference tasks by **name** or **ID** - the bot will figure out what you mean!

### Task Identification
- **By ID**: Use the exact numeric task ID (`/complete-task task:"1211480509573974"`)
- **By Name**: Use partial or full task names (`/complete-task task:"fix login bug"`)
- **Smart Search**: Bot searches your tasks and shows matches if multiple are found
- **Cross-Project**: Finds tasks across all projects you have access to

### Examples

**Complete a task:**
```
/complete-task task:"fix login bug"
/complete-task task:"1211480509573974"
```

**Update a task:**
```
/update-task task:"review code" assignee:@developer due_date:"2025-12-31"
/update-task task:"task name" assignee:@nyte  # Assign to yourself
/update-task task:"1211480509573974" name:"Updated task name"
```

**Delete a task:**
```
/delete-task task:"old task to remove"
/delete-task task:"1211480509573974"
```

### When Multiple Tasks Match

If your search matches multiple tasks, Botsana will show you options:
```
üéØ Multiple Tasks Found
Found 3 tasks matching 'bug'

Option 1: **Fix login bug** (ID: 1211480509573974)
Option 2: **Bug in homepage** (ID: 1211480509573975)
Option 3: **Bug report system** (ID: 1211480509573976)
```

Just use the exact task ID to specify which one you want!

**Never memorize task IDs again!** ü§ñ‚ú®

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Chat Channel

Botsana now understands natural language in designated chat channels! Mention the bot to create tasks using conversational language instead of rigid parameters.

### Setup

An administrator must first designate a channel for AI chat using:

```
/set-chat-channel #your-channel-name
```

Once configured, the bot will respond to @mentions in that channel.

### How It Works

Mention @Botsana in the designated channel and describe your task in natural language. The AI-powered parsing uses **Grok-4-Fast-Reasoning** to intelligently extract:
- Task names and descriptions
- Due dates (tomorrow, next week, specific dates)
- Assignee mentions (@username)
- Project references

**Smart Fallback**: If the xAI API is unavailable, the bot automatically falls back to regex-based parsing to ensure reliability.

### Examples

**Simple task creation:**
```
@Botsana Fix the login bug
```

**With due date:**
```
@Botsana Create a task to review the new feature due tomorrow
```

**With assignee:**
```
@Botsana Schedule a meeting with the team for Friday and assign to @developer
```

**Complex task:**
```
@Botsana I need to update documentation for the API next week with notes about the new endpoints
```

### What It Understands

- **Task Actions**: create, add, schedule, remind, I need to
- **Due Dates**: tomorrow, today, next week, next month, specific dates (MM/DD, YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Time References**: in 3 days, in 2 weeks
- **Assignees**: @username mentions
- **Projects**: "in marketing project", "for project X"

### Smart Confirmation

After parsing your request, Botsana replies with exactly what it understood and provides confirmation buttons. You can review the interpreted details before proceeding with task creation.

### Channel Management

- **Set Channel**: `/set-chat-channel #channel` (Admin only)
- **Remove Channel**: `/remove-chat-channel` (Admin only)
- **Check Status**: `/status` shows if chat channel is configured

The bot only responds to @mentions in the designated channel, keeping regular conversation unaffected.

## üìã Task Templates

Create reusable task configurations to standardize common workflows and save time.

### Creating Templates

Use `/create-template` to save task configurations for reuse:

```
/create-template name:"Bug Report" task_name:"üêõ Bug: {description}" assignee:@developer due_date_offset:3 notes:"Reported by: {reporter}\nPriority: {priority}\nSteps to reproduce:\n{steps}"
```

**Template Features:**
- **Custom task names** with variables like `{description}`, `{priority}`
- **Default assignees** and projects
- **Automatic due dates** (e.g., 3 days from creation)
- **Template descriptions** and usage notes
- **Usage tracking** and statistics

### Using Templates

Create tasks instantly from templates:

```
/use-template template:"Bug Report" custom_name:"üêõ Login button not working" notes:"User cannot click login after entering credentials"
```

**Override Options:**
- **custom_name**: Override the default task name
- **assignee**: Assign to different user
- **project**: Use different project
- **due_date**: Set specific due date
- **notes**: Add custom notes (appended to template notes)

### Managing Templates

- **`/list-templates`**: Browse all available templates
- **`/use-template`**: Create tasks from templates
- **`/delete-template`** (Admin): Remove templates

### Template Statistics

Templates track usage statistics:
- How many times each template has been used
- Who created each template
- When templates were last used

**Perfect for standardizing:**
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Support tickets
- Recurring tasks
- Department workflows

## üîç Advanced Search System

Powerful task search capabilities with comprehensive filtering, sorting, and saveable configurations.

### One-Time Advanced Search

- Disabled

**Assignment Notifications:**
- Enabled (default)
- Disabled

### How It Works

1. **Personalized**: Only you receive notifications about your tasks
2. **Respectful**: Honors your preferences - no spam if you disable notifications
3. **Informative**: Includes task details, time remaining, and quick action links
4. **Private**: Sent via DM to keep your inbox clean

### Example Notifications

**Due Date Reminder:**
```
‚è∞ Task Due Tomorrow
This task is due within the next 24 hours.

üìã Fix Login Bug
üìÖ Due Date: 2025-01-15
‚è∞ Time Remaining: 1 day
üîó View Task: Use /view-task task_id:12345
```

**Assignment Notification:**
```
üìã Task Assigned to You

üìù Task: Fix Login Bug
üìÖ Due Date: 2025-01-15
üîó View Task: Use /view-task task_id:12345
```

## Audit System

The Botsana audit system provides **real-time monitoring of ALL Asana activity** through webhooks and automated reporting.

### Audit Channels Created by `/audit-setup`:

- **#taskmaster** üìã - All task creations and deletions
- **#updates** üîÑ - Task updates, comments, status changes, and assignments
- **#completed** ‚úÖ - Tasks that have been completed
- **#due-soon** ‚è∞ - Tasks due within 24 hours (checked hourly)
- **#overdue** üö® - Currently overdue tasks
- **#missed-deadline** üíÄ - Tasks that missed their deadline (reported daily at 9 AM)
- **#new-projects** üìÅ - New project creations
- **#attachments** üìé - Files added to tasks

### How It Works:
1. **Real-time Webhooks**: Asana sends instant notifications for all activity
2. **Automated Reporting**: Scheduled jobs check for due dates and missed deadlines
3. **Rich Embeds**: Each event is formatted as a beautiful Discord embed
4. **Self-Sufficient**: Channels work automatically - no manual intervention needed

### Setup Instructions:
1. Run `/audit-setup` as an Administrator in your server
2. The bot will create the "ü§ñ Botsana" category and all channels
3. Webhooks are automatically registered with Asana
4. The system begins monitoring immediately

**Note**: The audit system monitors ALL Asana activity in your workspace, not just actions performed through the bot.

### Error Logging System

Botsana includes a comprehensive error logging and reporting system that automatically logs critical errors and system events to a designated Discord channel.

#### Setting Up Error Logging:
1. Create a private `#audit-log` channel in your server
2. Run `/set-audit-log #audit-log` as an Administrator
3. Critical errors will now be automatically logged with detailed information

#### What Gets Logged:
- Command execution errors
- Asana API failures
- Configuration changes
- System events and warnings
- Authentication issues

#### Error Log Format:
Each error includes:
- Error type and message
- User and guild context
- Command that triggered the error
- Timestamp and detailed stack traces
- Severity levels (ERROR, CRITICAL, WARNING)

### Database Persistence

Botsana uses **PostgreSQL database** for persistent storage that survives Heroku restarts and deployments:

#### Data Storage:
- **Guild configurations** - Audit channels, default projects
- **Error logs** - Complete error history with context
- **System statistics** - Bot usage and performance metrics

#### Database Features:
- **Automatic table creation** on first run
- **Connection pooling** for performance
- **Data integrity** with foreign keys and constraints
- **Migration-safe** schema design

#### Free Tier Limits:
- Heroku Postgres Essential-0: 1GB storage, 20 connections
- Suitable for most Discord bots with moderate usage

**All configuration and logs persist through restarts, deployments, and crashes.**

### Database Management

For security reasons, database operations like resets are **not available as Discord commands**. These operations require direct developer access:

#### Secure Database Operations:
- **Database resets** - Only executable via developer CLI access
- **Schema migrations** - Handled securely outside of Discord
- **Backup operations** - Managed through Heroku Postgres tools

#### Why This Design:
- **Security**: Prevents accidental or malicious data loss via Discord
- **Control**: Critical operations require explicit developer approval
- **Safety**: No risk of users accidentally deleting all bot data

### Status Command Features

The `/status` command provides comprehensive system health information:

#### Status Checks:
- **Bot Status** - Online/responding confirmation
- **Discord Connection** - Gateway latency and connection health
- **Asana API** - Authentication and API connectivity
- **Database** - PostgreSQL connection and health
- **Audit System** - Configuration and channel status
- **Error Statistics** - Recent error counts and trends
- **Bot Statistics** - Server and user counts
- **System Info** - Python version and library versions

#### Use Cases:
- Quick health check after deployments
- Troubleshooting connectivity issues
- Monitoring system performance
- Verifying configuration changes

## Heroku Deployment

1. **Create a Heroku app:**
   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```

2. **Set environment variables in Heroku:**
   ```bash
   heroku config:set DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   heroku config:set ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_asana_personal_access_token
   heroku config:set ASANA_WORKSPACE_ID=your_workspace_id
   heroku config:set ASANA_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID=your_default_project_id
   heroku config:set XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key
   ```

3. **Deploy to Heroku:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push heroku main
   ```

## Configuration

### Getting Your Asana Credentials

1. **Asana Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to [Asana Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps)
   - Create a new token with appropriate permissions
   - It will look like: `1/1234567890:abcdef...`

2. **Asana Workspace ID:**
   - Look at the URL when you're in your Asana workspace
   - The ID is the long number in the URL (e.g., `1234567890123456`)

### Getting Your xAI API Key

1. **Go to [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai/)**
2. **Sign in** with your xAI account
3. **Navigate to API Keys** section
4. **Create a new API key** for your project
5. **Copy the API key** - it will look like: `xai-...`

The bot uses the `grok-4-fast-reasoning` model for advanced natural language processing of task creation requests.

### Updating Environment Variables

If you need to update credentials after deployment:

```bash
heroku config:set ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_new_token
heroku config:set ASANA_WORKSPACE_ID=your_workspace_id
heroku config:set ASANA_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
heroku config:set XAI_API_KEY=your_new_xai_api_key
```

**Bot Commands:**
- `/create-task name:"Task name" project:"Project ID"`
- `/update-task id:12345 name:"New name"`
- `/complete-task id:12345`
- `/list-tasks project:"Project ID"`
- `/delete-task id:12345`
- `/view-task id:12345`
