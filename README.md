- Asana Workspace ID and Project ID (optional)

## Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in your credentials:
     ```env
     DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
     ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_asana_personal_access_token
     ASANA_WORKSPACE_ID=your_workspace_id

   ```

## Discord Commands

### Task Management
- `/create-task name:"Task name" due:"2025-12-31" project:"Project ID"` - Create a new task
- `/update-task id:12345 name:"New name" due:"2025-12-31"` - Update an existing task
- `/complete-task id:12345` - Mark a task as completed
- `/list-tasks project:"Project ID"` - List tasks in a project
- `/delete-task id:12345` - Delete a task
- `/view-task id:12345` - View task details
- `/help` - Show all commands

### Audit System Setup
- `/audit-setup` - **ADMIN ONLY** - Set up the Botsana audit category and channels

## Audit System

The Botsana audit system provides **real-time monitoring of ALL Asana activity** through webhooks and automated reporting.

### Audit Channels Created by `/audit-setup`:

- **#taskmaster** üìã - All task creations and deletions
- **#updates** üîÑ - Task updates, comments, status changes, and assignments
- **#completed** ‚úÖ - Tasks that have been completed
- **#due-soon** ‚è∞ - Tasks due within 24 hours (checked hourly)
- **#overdue** üö® - Currently overdue tasks
- **#missed-deadline** üíÄ - Tasks that missed their deadline (reported daily at 9 AM)
- **#new-projects** üìÅ - New project creations
- **#attachments** üìé - Files added to tasks

### How It Works:
1. **Real-time Webhooks**: Asana sends instant notifications for all activity
2. **Automated Reporting**: Scheduled jobs check for due dates and missed deadlines
3. **Rich Embeds**: Each event is formatted as a beautiful Discord embed
4. **Self-Sufficient**: Channels work automatically - no manual intervention needed

### Setup Instructions:
1. Run `/audit-setup` as an Administrator in your server
2. The bot will create the "ü§ñ Botsana" category and all channels
3. Webhooks are automatically registered with Asana
4. The system begins monitoring immediately

**Note**: The audit system monitors ALL Asana activity in your workspace, not just actions performed through the bot.

**For Future Reference - How to Configure Credentials:**

If you need to update credentials in the future:

1. **Update Asana environment variables in Heroku:**
   ```bash
   heroku config:set ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_new_token
   heroku config:set ASANA_WORKSPACE_ID=your_workspace_id
   heroku config:set ASANA_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   ```

2. **Get your Asana Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to [Asana Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Personal Access Tokens](https://app.asana.com/0/my-apps)
   - Create a new token with appropriate permissions

3. **Find your Asana Workspace ID:**
   - Look at the URL when you're in your Asana workspace
   - The ID is the long number in the URL (e.g., `1234567890123456`)

**Bot Commands:**
- `/create-task name:"Task name" project:"Project ID"`
- `/update-task id:12345 name:"New name"`
- `/complete-task id:12345`
- `/list-tasks project:"Project ID"`
- `/delete-task id:12345`
- `/view-task id:12345`
- `/help`

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file or expose tokens in your code
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Regenerate tokens if they are accidentally exposed
- The bot uses Asana's official Python client for secure API communication

## Development

The bot is built with:
- `discord.py` for Discord integration
- `asana` Python SDK for Asana API
- `python-dotenv` for environment variable management
